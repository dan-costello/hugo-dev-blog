# welcome to my blog

Hello! My name is Dan and I've built software for everything from petrophysical well log analysis to LLM-powered chatbots. This blog will be where I'll unpack what I've learned (and what I'm still figuring out). I also plan to write some about my journey from working as a geologist in the oil and gas industry to a career in software development.
