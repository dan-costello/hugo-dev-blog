With the introduction of Tauri version 2.0, we wanted to migrate to the latest version to take advantage of its new features, which include the options to compile mobile operating systems in addition to desktop environments.\nI took the initiative of testing migration with one of the applications i am responsible for. While Tauri’s migration docs are well-written, there were many changes required, some of which were unintuitive. The new permissions model, while powerful, offers an overly granular level of control for some of the simple applications we’ve built. I completed the migration, and the application worked well in my development testing on Windows. But then I hit a larger hurdle - the fact that we ship our apps on both WIndows and Linux, and most our major clients are on Red Hat Enterprise 8 (RHEL8) for their Linux machines. Attempting a Tauri build on our RHEL8 machines revealed that a few OS libraries were below the minimum supported version for Tauri version 2.\nThis was disappointing, but not overly so. Tauri version 1 is a powerful framework, and we can achieve most any goals in our roadmap. I preserved my app’s migration in a GitHub branch so that we could come back to this when Red Hat 9 is the minimum supported version for enterprise Linux deployments. However - this might not be a while - Red Hat 8 end of life is not until 2029!\nWe could theoretically build on RHEL9 to enable clients who are upgrading their operating systems sooner. I revisited my working branch this week on a RHEL9 machine, only to find that the OS libraries (namely, WebKit, souplib, and Glib) did not meet Tauri version 2 minimum requirements.\nThis problem reveals different approaches to development represented by the Tauri and Red Hat teams. Tauri is pushing modern development using languages such as Typescript and Rust, utilizing the latest Linux libraries to aid in development of next-generation applications. Red Hat takes the opposite view, focusing on stability and minimizing the chance of vulnerabilities of breaking changes. This is due to Red Hat’s focus on deployments in enterprise clients - they don’t want to update a system library until it’s been verified and tested for years in other operating systems.\nFor our use cases, we’ll continue to use Tauri version 1 for application development. This version will continue to get bug fixes and security patches, and the framework is flexible enough that we can build any feature that we have in mind. And when Red Hat 10 becomes the de facto enterprise Linux OS, we’ll be ready to migrate to Tauri 2!\n","wordCount":"508","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"2025-08-10T13:38:02-04:00","dateModified":"2025-08-10T13:38:02-04:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Dan Costello"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/tauri-and-redhat/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Digital Reservoirs","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Digital Reservoirs (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Digital Reservoirs</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
